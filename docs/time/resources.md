### Extensions

The PI tasks are easily extensible.

[Yoav Bar-Anan](http://www.bgu.ac.il/~baranany/) from [Project Implicit](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/aboutus.html)
has created several extensions for the easy creation of a few common reaction-time tasks. 
You can find the instructions for using them right [here](https://git.io/JvE5H).
